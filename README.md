# odin-css

I'm a complete beginner who started to studying with ODIN and I really liking it the way they taught us with exercises and projects.

This is my first harder Project I've ever done....but with lots of messy codes.

I did some google but i managed to complete with everything ODIN taught me so far

the thing i searched was width:70%;
